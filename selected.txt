The effect of the lecture discussion teaching method with and without audio-visual augmentation on immediate and retention learning without audio-visuals. A convenience sample of 52 students divided into two groups voluntarily participated in the quasi-experiment. Two teaching sessions averaging 90 minutes in length were taught by the researcher. Learning and retention were measured by a 10-item multiple choice test with content validity. Immediate learning was measured with a post-test administered immediately following each of the teaching sessions. Delayed learning was measured with a retention test administered 25.5 days following the teaching sessions. Group data was analysed using an independent one tailed t-test for mean scores. Students attending the lecture-discussion with audio-visual augmentation did not achieve significantly higher mean scores on the two tests than the non-augmented group (p < or = to 0.05). Analysis using a paired t-test revealed that the difference in scores between the post-test and retention test for the group without audio-visual augmentation was significant (t = 2.31; p < 0.05). Delayed retention appears to have been influenced by the use of audio-visuals. Nurse educators need to consider ways in which the lecture-discussion may be enhanced to maximise student learning and retention

Effects of pacing and practice on learning a psychomotor skill using computer-interactive video as the instructional method preparation to a convenience sample of ninety basic level nursing students. An experimental 2 x 2 factorial design was used to determine the effects of the two independent variables. The variables were: control of pacing, which had two levels, learner control and program control, and practice, with two levels, opportunity to practice and no opportunity to practice. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative effects of these two constructs on psychomotor learning and on cognitive learning of IV therapy preparation using CIAV. The two measures of instructional effects were a performance test that was videotaped and judged by two nurse experts and a thirty question cognitive test. A third independent variable was perceived time to mastery. The study also examined learning efficiency. While viewing the CIAV, some subjects had the opportunity to practice with the equipment and some subjects did not. One group of subjects had control of the program's pacing by touching the screen to advance the program, while another group had an automated self pacing program. After completing the CIAV on IV Therapy subjects were videotaped while performing the skill and then a written test was administered. Statistical parameters were set according to predicted effect sizes with an a =.10, b = 87%, n = 45 and d =.50. Standardized differences between the means of practice and learner control revealed that practice was the more potent variable. Analysis of variance of the practice/no practice effect revealed statistical significance. Analysis of variance of the control of the pacing variable found no significance between the program control and the learner control groups. Perceived time to mastery was longer in the program control group. Maximum time for all subjects was 31 minutes. There was a positive correlation between age and skill performance. Ninety-five percent of the students who had learner control and opportunity to practice reached mastery

An experimental assessment of varied fidelity in instructional simulation on the facilitation of immediate and delayed performance of intravenous calculation and regulation real item. Nursing students must learn many procedures when preparing for professional practice. Sometimes real equipment can be used and sometimes it is prohibitive from a cost and safety standpoint. To date there is no evidence that any variation in the physical and functional fidelity characteristics of a simulation make a difference in instructional outcomes. This dissertation examined varied fidelity in instructional simulations on the facilitation of immediate and delayed performance of intravenous calculation and regulation. Defined levels of low, moderate and high physical and functional fidelity were used in treatments designed to teach intravenous therapy calculation and regulation. Randomly assigned to treatments, students took both an immediate and two week delayed test for both cognitive and psychomotor ability. All treatments were similarly effective in outcome. The cognitive measures all produced fairly high scores. The psychomotor measures revealed less accurate performance across treatments. A trend for students with more prior education to do better on both measures and a significant time difference across treatments was also discovered. This dissertation provides a groundwork for similar studies probing the most effective and efficient learning strategies for nursing education

Computer-assisted interactive video instruction: an alternative to the lecture method for nutrition education in baccalaureate nursing control and experimental groups, instruction method, and student GPA. The subjects used in this study were third-quarter-junior-baccalaureate nursing students randomly selected for the experimental and control groups. The control group of students attended the traditional lecture-based method of instruction and the experimental group had the experience with the CAIVI. The t test for Independent Groups was used to determine the difference between the control group and experimental group of students' achievement test scores. The t test was not significant at the 95 percent level of confidence; however, the confidence interval showed that the difference was in the direction of the CAIVI method of instruction. A correlation coefficient was calculated for GPA and achievement test scores, students in the control having the higher GPA did score significantly higher, (p < .01); the CAIVI group did not score significantly higher. The Kuder-Richardson 20 used to estimate reliability of the test indicated r =.18. The degree of difficulty and how well these questions discriminated were also measured. The experimental group of students completed an evaluation of the CAIVI program with average score value of 4.4 out of a maximum of 5.0.

Math achievement of adult and traditional associate degree nursing students taught via computer-assisted and lecture instruction investigate the difference between math achievement in a nursing drugs and calculations course of 112 Associate Degree Nursing students randomly assigned to a CAI math group (Experimental) or a lecture math group (Control). It also examined if the differences in math achievement were related to age, race, anxiety level, faculty conference time, and ACT scores. Using multiple linear regression, no significant differences in math achievement between the two methods of instruction were found. No significant independent relationships were found between math achievement and race, anxiety level, and ACT. There were significant independent relationships found between math achievement and student age and faculty conference time. The adult nursing students (25 years and older) in the CAI group received higher final math scores and required less faculty conference time than students in the lecture math group
